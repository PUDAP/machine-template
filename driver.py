"""
Example driver class for a machine.

All public methods should be documented with a docstring, arguments, and return type.

Methods that are not part of the puda CLI contract (helpers, one-off utilities, anything
the operator should not invoke as a machine command) must be private: define them with a
leading underscore (e.g. ``_poll_status``). Only public names are exposed to puda; private
names stay internal to this driver implementation.

Below are the public methods that are exposed to the puda CLI.

- `shutdown`
- `home`
- `reset`
